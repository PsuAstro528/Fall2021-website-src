## Create Account at ICDS-ACI/Roar

All students should [request an ACI account](https://www.icds.psu.edu/computing-services/account-setup/) before the second class meeting.  
On the account request form, 

- specify ebf11 as the sponsor account,
- list Astro528 as the research description,  
- leave computational and Data Requirements box blank (since they already know what will be required for the class.)  

Students who already have an ACI account should contact [i-ASK](https://iask.aci.ics.psu.edu/) to request that they add your account to the Astro 528 group.
