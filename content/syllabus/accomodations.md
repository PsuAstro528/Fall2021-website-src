## Academic Success, Learning Assistance, & Student Resources

The Eberly College of Science is committed to the academic success of students enrolled in the College's courses and undergraduate programs.  When in need of help, students can utilize various College and University wide resources for learning assistance.

## Accomodations
Note to Students with Disabilities:

Penn State welcomes students with disabilities into the University’s educational programs. Every Penn State campus has an office for students with disabilities. [Student Disability Resources (SDR) website](http://equity.psu.edu/sdr/disability-coordinator) provides contact information for every Penn State campus (http://equity.psu.edu/sdr/disability-coordinator). For further information, please visit [Student Disability Resources website](http://equity.psu.edu/sdr/) http://equity.psu.edu/sdr/).

In order to receive consideration for reasonable accommodations, you must contact the appropriate disability services office at the campus where you are officially enrolled, participate in an intake interview, and provide documentation: See [documentation guidelines](http://equity.psu.edu/sdr/guidelines) (http://equity.psu.edu/sdr/guidelines). If the documentation supports your request for reasonable accommodations, your campus disability services office will provide you with an accommodation letter. Please share this letter with your instructors and discuss the accommodations with them as early as possible. You must follow this process for every semester that you request accommodations.

## Counseling and Psychological Services

Many students at Penn State face personal challenges or have psychological needs that may interfere with their academic progress, social development, or emotional wellbeing. The university offers a variety of confidential services to help you through difficult times, including individual and group counseling, crisis intervention, consultations, online chats, and mental health screenings. These services are provided by staff who welcome all students and embrace a philosophy respectful of clients’ cultural and religious backgrounds, and sensitive to differences in race, ability, gender identity and sexual orientation.

- [Counseling and Psychological Services at University Park  (CAPS)](http://studentaffairs.psu.edu/counseling/): 814-863-0395
- Penn State Crisis Line (24 hours/7 days/week): 877-229-6400
Crisis Text Line (24 hours/7 days/week): Text LIONS to 741741

This is likely to be another particularly challenging year, and students are encouraged to make use of these services. 

## Educational Equity

Penn State takes great pride to foster a diverse and inclusive environment for students, faculty, and staff. Acts of intolerance, discrimination, or harassment due to age, ancestry, color, disability, gender, gender identity, national origin, race, religious belief, sexual orientation, or veteran status are not tolerated and can be reported through Educational Equity via the [Report Bias webpage](http://equity.psu.edu/reportbias/).
