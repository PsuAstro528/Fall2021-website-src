## Accomodations
Note to Students with Disabilities:

Penn State welcomes students with disabilities into the Universityâ€™s educational programs. Every Penn State campus has an office for students with disabilities. [Student Disability Resources (SDR) website](http://equity.psu.edu/sdr/disability-coordinator) provides contact information for every Penn State campus (http://equity.psu.edu/sdr/disability-coordinator). For further information, please visit [Student Disability Resources website](http://equity.psu.edu/sdr/) http://equity.psu.edu/sdr/).

In order to receive consideration for reasonable accommodations, you must contact the appropriate disability services office at the campus where you are officially enrolled, participate in an intake interview, and provide documentation: See [documentation guidelines](http://equity.psu.edu/sdr/guidelines) (http://equity.psu.edu/sdr/guidelines). If the documentation supports your request for reasonable accommodations, your campus disability services office will provide you with an accommodation letter. Please share this letter with your instructors and discuss the accommodations with them as early as possible. You must follow this process for every semester that you request accommodations.
