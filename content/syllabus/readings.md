## Textbooks
The required textbooks for this course are:

- _Writing Scientific Software: A Guide to Good Style_ by Suely Oliveira, Cambridge University Press, 1st edition, September 18, 2006,  ISBN-10: 0521858968.  (I recommend considering a used version.)
- _[Think Julia: How to Think like a Computer Scientist](https://benlauwens.github.io/ThinkJulia.jl/latest/book.html)_ by Ben Lauwens and Allen Downey, 1st edition, May 14, 2019.  ISBN-10:1492045039 (I recommend using the version avaliable online for free.)

I will also suggest readings from an optional textbook: 
- _Introduction to High Performance Computing for Scientists and Engineers_ by Georg Hager &amp; Gerhard Wellein, CRC Press, 1st edition, July 2, 2010,  ISBN-10: 143981192X
Whenever readings from _Introduction to High Performance Computing for Scientists and Engineers_ are suggested, there will be alternative online reading assignments for students who prefer not to purchase another textbook.  Hopefully, different students reading from different sources will help stimulate interesting discussion about commonalities and differences across sources.

## Additional Readings
